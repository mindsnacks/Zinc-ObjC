# Zinc-ObjC

Objective-C client for Zinc asset distribution system. Common use cases for
Zinc are for downloading content purchased through an in-app-purchase
mechanism, or to avoid packaging large files inside your app package if they
may not be needed.

## Feature Highlights

 - Zinc bundles are presented as familiar NSBundles
 - Zinc bundles can be updated manually or automatically
 - A Zinc bundle will never be updated while it's in use.
 - Multiple remote catalogs can be tracked.
 - The Zinc client knows about which files have changed, and only downloads the
   necessary files.
 - Bundles can be filtered into "flavors" (to support 1x, 2x images, etc)

## Status:

Zinc-ObjC is under *active* development 'beta' quality.

## About Zinc

More about the Zinc system can be found at the main [Zinc repo](http://github.com/mindsnacks/Zinc).

Here's an except from the main Zinc documentation:

The central concept in Zinc is a "bundle", which is just a group of assets. For
example, a bundle could be a level for a game, which includes spritesheets,
background music, and metadata.

Zinc bundles are also versioned, which means they can be updated. For example,
if you wanted to change the background music in a game, you can do that by
pushing a new version of that bundle.

Finally, Zinc also has a notion of "distributions" for a bundles, which are
basically just tags. This allows clients to track a tag such as `master`
instead of the version directly. Then whenever the `master` distribution is
updated, clients will automatically download the changes.
